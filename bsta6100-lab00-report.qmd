# Lab Assignment

## Question 1

::: question
We're going to start by playing a bit with Quarto. Read carefully through the text below and apply formatting to it as follows:

1.  Make the text "Tips and Tricks for Quarto" bold.
2.  Make the text "Knit and knit often" italic.
3.  Make the text "Make sure your chunk syntax is correct" italic.
4.  Make the text "Be persistent!" bold.

Tips and Tricks for Quarto

1.  Knit and knit often. You'll be turning in  for grading, and it's important that you know what it looks like!
2.  Make sure your chunk syntax is correct. You should only have one set of opening and closing backticks (\`\`\`) per chunk!
3.  Be persistent! Learning R takes time, and it's okay if you don't get it right away. Just keep trying, and don't be afraid to ask for help!

## Question 2

::: question
Use R as a calculator to compute the following values. Assign the first value the name `x`, the second value the name `y`, and the third `z`. $$\frac{27}{2 + 3^2}$$ $$\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} \times 0.257$$ $$92^3 - 734$$

```{r question2, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

```{r question2Answers, error = T, collapse = T}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK: it's how we'll check your work. YOUR ANSWERS GO IN THE CHUNK ABOVE THIS ONE.
x
y
z
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CHUNK

## Question 3

In Questions 3-5, we'll be using a data set we'll call `a2trees` that contains information about a subset of the top 9 types of trees planted around Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2009. The city maintains an interactive map of all such trees at [this link](https://gisappsecure.ewashtenaw.org/Html5Viewer_2_11/index.html?viewer=A2Trees.A2Trees).


:::{.question}
We'll start by reading in the data. The data are stored in a file called `a2trees_clean.csv`. We give the name of this file (*in quotes!*) to the `read.csv()` function. Complete this task in the chunk set up below by reading the .csv file and calling it `a2trees`.
:::

:::{.answer}
```{r}
#| label: question3
#| error: true

# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```
:::


## Question 4

:::{.question}
Produce appropriate numerical summaries of the variable `ConditionTreeHealth`.
:::

:::{.answer}
```{r question4, error = T}
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```

:::

## Question 5

:::{.question}
Make an appropriate graphical display for the variable `ConditionTreeHealth`. Be sure to include a proper title and axis labels as appropriate.
:::

:::{.answer}
```{r}
#| label: question5
#| error: true
# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).

```
:::

## Question 6

:::{.question}
Make a two-way contingency table for tree health and common genus.
:::

:::{.answer}
```{r}
#| label: question6
#| error: true

# Use this code chunk to write the code necessary to answer the question. Do not start your code on this line, and do not start your code with # (this is a comment, R will ignore it).
